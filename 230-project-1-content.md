#Gameplay
###*Mechanics*
-The player can adjust the height that they are flying at however if they fly too high their “fly bar” starts draining and they start to fall if they run out
-If they fall to the ground they are stuck and must wait for their fly bar to regen so they can get back in the air
-There are obstacles that appear along the track as the player is flying and they must avoid them and if the player does hit them they have different effects
-The player can also “sprint” which increases their speed but drains “stamina bar” and also makes it harder to avoid obstacles
-If their stamina bar runs out they are significantly slower for a period of time

###*Control*
-Keyboard and mouse 

###*Onboarding*
-The controls are displayed on the screen for a couple seconds before the race starts
-The game is very simple and there are only two or three controls so a tutorial is probably unnecessary 

###*Player Learning*
-The player needs to learn that obstacles are bad and that different obstacles have different effects
..-Some will drain either their fly or stamina bar
-The player needs to learn that they can't always fly or always sprint for the entirety of the race and if they go for too long they will suffer negative consequences
